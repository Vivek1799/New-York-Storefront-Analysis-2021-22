This repository contains data and analysis on trends for New York City's New York City Storefront Analysis from 2019 to 2022.

Key Trends

Vacancy rates have increased significantly citywide since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, with nearly every neighborhood seeing more empty storefronts. Manhattan neighborhoods have seen the largest jumps.

The total number of storefronts across the city has declined from 2019 to 2022, indicating that businesses are permanently closing at a higher rate than new retailers are opening.

Within boroughs, there is variation at the neighborhood level. Some neighborhoods have shown tentative signs of recovery with declining vacancy rates, while others have seen vacancy rates continue to increase.

Prime retail districts in Manhattan like Midtown, SoHo, and the Upper East Side have some of the highest vacancy rates, reaching as high as 20%. Remote work has reduced foot traffic in these areas, exacerbating challenges.

A regression analysis found that commercial rent prices, not poverty rates or unemployment, correlated most strongly with retail health. This indicates that foot traffic and customer demand may be more important factors for businesses.

However, the limited data span of 2019 to 2022 and lack of granular information on business revenues and lease terms hinders a full understanding of New York City's retail challenges. More comprehensive, long-term data is needed.
